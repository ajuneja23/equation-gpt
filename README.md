# Fixed Digit Token Research : Language Models for Equations

Credit to Karpathy lectures for the base GPT implementation used. We are researching if we can freeze the embeddings of digit tokens in mathematical equations (e.g. 0 to [0,0..,0], 1 to [0.1,0.1..,0.1], etc.) to see if this results in enhanced mathematical reasoning capabilitiess
